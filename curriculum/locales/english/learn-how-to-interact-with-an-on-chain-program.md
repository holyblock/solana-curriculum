### --description--

Previously, you developed a smart contract that kept count of the number of times it was invoked.

Now, you will develop a client to call your smart contract.

Start by building your smart contract with:

```bash
npm run build
```

### --tests--

You should run `npm run build` in `learn-how-to-interact-with-an-on-chain-program`.

```js

```

## 2

### --description--

Within the `src` directory, create a directory named `client` to hold your code.

### --tests--

You should have a `src/client` directory.

```js

```

## 3

### --description--

Within the `src/client` directory, create a file named `main.js` which will be the entrypoint of your program.

### --tests--

You should have a `src/client/main.js` file.

```js

```

## 4

### --description--

Within `src/client/main.js`, create an asynchronous function named `main`.

### --tests--

You should have an asynchronous function with the handle `main`.

```js

```

## 5

### --description--

Call your `main` function, awaiting the process before exiting.

### --tests--

You should call `main` with `await`.

```js
