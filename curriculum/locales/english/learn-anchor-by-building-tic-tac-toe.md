# Solana - Learn Anchor by Building Tic-Tac-Toe

## 1

### --description--

Previously, you built and deployed a program (smart contract) to the Solana blockchain using the native `solana_program` crate. In this project, you will use the Anchor framework to build and deploy a program to the Solana blockchain.

Anchor offers quick and convenient tools and modules for building and deploying programs.

Open a new terminal, and install the Anchor Version Manager (AVM) to get started.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
```

### --tests--

You should have `avm` installed.

```js
assert.fail();
```

Anchor Version Manager is a tool for using multiple versions of the Anchor CLI.

Use `avm` to install the latest version of the Anchor CLI.

```bash
avm install latest
```

**Note:** Technically, this step is not necessary as the latest version of the Anchor CLI is installed by default.

### --tests--

You should have the latest version of the Anchor CLI installed.

```js
assert.fail();
```

### --description--

You will be building a Tic-Tac-Toe game on the Solana blockchain.

Within `learn-anchor-by-building-tic-tac-toe/`, create a new project named `tic-tac-toe`:

```bash
anchor init --no-git tic-tac-toe
```

**Note:** The `--no-git` flag is used to prevent the project from being initialized as a git repository.

### --tests--

You should be in the `learn-anchor-by-building-tic-tac-toe` directory.

```js
assert.fail();
```

You should have a `tic-tac-toe` directory.

```js
assert.fail();
```
