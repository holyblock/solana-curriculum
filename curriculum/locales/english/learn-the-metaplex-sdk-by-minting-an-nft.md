# Solana - Learn the Metaplex SDK by Minting an NFT

## 1

### --description--

In this project, you will learn how to use the Metaplex JavaScript SDK to mint a <dfn title="A digitally transferable asset whose supply is 1">Non-Fungible Token (NFT)</dfn> on the Solana blockchain. You will learn how to add metadata to your NFT, and how to upload your NFT somewhere it can be viewed by others.

For the duration of this project, you will be working in the `learn-the-metaplex-sdk-by-minting-an-nft/` directory.

Change into the above directory in a new bash terminal.

### --tests--

You can use `cd` to change into the `learn-the-metaplex-sdk-by-minting-an-nft/` directory.

```js
const cwdFile = await __helpers.getCWD();
const cwd = cwdFile.split('\n').filter(Boolean).pop();
assert.include(cwd, 'learn-the-metaplex-sdk-by-minting-an-nft');
```
